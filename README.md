## 🔍 Research Profile

My research focuses on transforming fragmented **BIM–IoT–FM** data into **executable, explainable, and reusable digital-twin workflows**.  
I design **ontology-driven semantic execution frameworks** that bridge **information modeling, graph-based reasoning, and operational action**, enabling predictive maintenance, lifecycle carbon management, and governance-aware automation.

My work is characterized by the following directions:

- **Action-Oriented Semantic Digital Twins**  
  Moving beyond data-centric digital twins toward *executable twins* that explicitly connect semantic reasoning with real-world actions (e.g., predictive maintenance, procurement decisions, carbon mitigation workflows).

- **Ontology-Driven Automation & Modular Domain Packs**  
  Developing reusable sem
