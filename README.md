## 👋 Hi, I'm Nora Huang (Chien-Pu Huang)

🎓 **PhD, Civil Engineering (Engineering Informatics)**  
🏛 **Postdoctoral Researcher @ NTU BIM Center, National Taiwan University**

🔬 I work on **Semantic Digital Twins, Ontology-Driven Automation, and Action-Oriented Knowledge Graphs** for smart and sustainable built environments.

## 🔍 Research Profile

My research focuses on transforming fragmented **BIM–IoT–FM** data into **executable, explainable, and reusable digital-twin workflows**.  
I design **ontology-driven semantic execution frameworks** that bridge **information modeling, graph-based reasoning, and operational action**, enabling predictive maintenance, lifecycle carbon management, and governance-aware automation.

My work is characterized by the following directions:

- **Action-Oriented Semantic Digital Twins**  
  Moving beyond data-centric digital twins toward *executable twins* that explicitly connect semantic reasoning with real-world actions (e.g., predictive maintenance, procurement decisions, carbon mitigation workflows).

- **Ontology-Driven Automation & Modular Domain Packs**  
  Developing reusable semantic capability units that encapsulate ontologies, mappings, reasoning rules, and action templates, enabling cross-domain automation without hard-coded workflows.

- **Graph-Native Reasoning Infrastructure**  
  Leveraging Neo4j-based knowledge graphs and traversal-based reasoning to support explainable, real-time decision logic across BIM models, sensor streams, and lifecycle data.

- **Lifecycle & Carbon-Smart Integration**  
  Supporting end-to-end lifecycle interoperability aligned with **BS EN 15978**, **GHG Protocol**, and sustainability-driven decision-making processes.

- **FAIR & AI-Ready Data Pipelines**  
  Structuring built-environment data to be interoperable, traceable, and reusable, while remaining ready for downstream AI analytics and automation under semantic governance.
